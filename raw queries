Error Code: 1248. Every derived table must have its own alias
Catch- Every derived table (AKA sub-query) must have an alias. I.e. each query in brackets must be given an alias (AS whatever), which can be used to refer to it in the rest of the outer query.

select * from (select museum.museum_id, museum.name as museum_name, work.name as 'painting name', work.work_id from museum inner join work on museum.museum_id=work.museum_id) as temp where museum_id is null;
